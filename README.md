# Live Coding Haskell

Content from [live coding](https://www.livecoding.tv/mgreenly/) sessions.

## Current Project

My current goal is just to get familiar with common Haskell libraries I'd expect
to use in backend web server programming.  Some thing's I expect I'll spend
time exploring:

  * serialization - json / yaml / etc...
  * http(s) network stuff, basic restful get/put etc...
  * command line parsing
  * sql database access
  * date time calculations
  * running external processes
  * ...
